        Hello , I am r3ndo0 I am a self-taught web developer. Just like every
        other new-comer to this industry, I started with HTML , CSS and a bit of
        JS, very soon moved into ReactJS (which I am not sure if it was the best
        decision to make). I am familiar with NextJS and its features(SSR,Folder
        based routing etc.) I like TailwindCSS and prefer it over plain CSS. I
        am familiar with MongoDB and CRUD operations with NodeJS. My favorite
        part of web development so far has been creating and dealing with
        RESTful APIs. I am passionate about learning new technologies and stacks
        as long as there is a documentation about them available. I have a few
        freelancing projects in hand right now which are not done yet and you
        can find them codes in my github profile(github.com/r3ndo0). And in the
        end, I would like to thank you for putting time into taking a look into
        my Portfolio and I want to let you know, as I have never worked in a
        team or a company,I am OK with internships without getting paid for the
        first one or two months. Best Regards
      </p>
